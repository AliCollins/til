# Markdown Basics

See [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
and [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

## Code
Inline code has only one \` around it (`this is code`), where as block of code requires 3 \` (i.e. \`\`\` )
```markdown
This is in a block of code
```
